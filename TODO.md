    # TODO: Improve Website Design with Stoic Greek Vibes and Epic Animations

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update font in style.css to a serif font (e.g., 'Crimson Text') for stoic, ancient Greek feel.
- [x] Add subtle marble-like textures or gradients to backgrounds (hero and cards) to evoke Greek architecture.
- [x] Incorporate gold accents (#D4AF37) for borders or highlights to add epicness.
- [x] Improve CTAs: Add icons (using Font Awesome), larger shadows, and pulse animations on hover.
- [x] Add epic animations: Fade-in effects for sections on load, enhanced card hover (lift and glow), and smooth transitions.
- [x] Update main.js to add scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer for better performance.
- [x] Add Font Awesome link to index.html for icons.
- [x] Test the site in a browser to ensure animations work and design looks epic.
